### How to run

1. Clone repo
2. Open in editor
3. Do ```ionic serve``` for opening in the web (unadvised) it looks terrible on web
  - If using web, please do ctrl+shift+i on windows and cmd+option+i on mac. Then do ctrl+shift+m for windows and cmd+shift+m for mac. 

Run through emulator otherwise, X-code for iOS, Android Studio for android.
